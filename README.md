wp-cli-rest
-----------

This is a plugin which allows you to access the basics functions of wp-cli but using the REST interface.

This is because my organisation is paying Â£110 a year for a plugin that is pretty good but does not have an API interface. Instead of rewriting an API, I decided to just write a wrapper for WP-CLI.

Installation is the same as normal wp-cli, please stick it in the same directory as plugin.php (for the moment)
